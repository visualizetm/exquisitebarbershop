# Progress

One block per milestone, newest at the bottom. Each names what shipped, the
commit, and what is still open.

## Prompt 4

### Milestone 1: living docs, tokens, fonts, kit

- Shipped: `docs/SITE-REPORT.md`, `docs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`, this file and
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`; `src/styles/tokens.css`, `base.css`, `kit.css`; Jost
  self-hosted; the kit in `src/components/ui` (Button, Input, Select, Textarea,
  Chip, Card, Sheet, Toast, EmptyState, ErrorState, Nav, Footer, StepBar,
  StickyCTA, PhotoArch, ChairCard, TimeChip, Ticket, Lightbox); placeholder
  brand marks in `public/brand/`; the dev-only `/kit` page; the screenshot
  script. The public layout now uses the kit Nav and Footer.
- Screens: `docs/screens/m1/` (kit and home at 390 and 1280, plus montages).
- Open: every page still has its prompt 1 to 3 markup; the design pass on them
  is milestones 3 and 4.

### Milestone 2: storage, photos, next opening

- Shipped: the storage port with `r2` (aws4fetch) and `local` drivers; the
  `photos` collection with its two indexes; upload-url, confirm, list, PATCH and
  DELETE for photos with owner and barber scopes; purge in the daily cron;
  staff photos on `/api/staff`, the hero on `/api/shop`, `GET /api/gallery`;
  `GET /api/availability/next`, `GET /api/staff/:slug/openings`, `count` on
  the days endpoint; `/book` lands on details for a time from a link and steps
  back with a notice when it is gone. New settings: `permissions.barbersCanUploadPhotos`
  and `nextOpenServiceId`.
- Tests: photos (limits, server keys, confirm mismatches, signed PUT, local
  driver end to end, gallery paging, barber scope), next opening (status, owner
  service, off and closed days, openings, days count), a unit test for the
  label, and the authorization matrix at 71 routes x 4 roles.
- Open: the Photos screen and the browser-side resize to WebP are milestone 4.

### Milestone 3: public pages

- Shipped: Home (hero with the R2 photo or the ink band, today's chairs strip
  from `/api/availability/next`, services preview with group chips, the work
  grid with the Lightbox, visit with today highlighted, the ink band), Services,
  The chairs (grid in chair order), the profile (arch photo, badge, next
  openings as TimeChips into /book with date and time, services, work strip,
  Instagram, sticky Book on phones, alias redirect), Gallery (per chair chips
  with counts, lazy grid with dimensions, Lightbox, load more), Visit (hours,
  address, Directions, Call, policies, parking placeholder) and Not found.
  Shared pieces in `src/components/site/`; layout in `src/styles/pages.css`.
- Tests: e2e for the home strip linking to /book?barber, the profile chip
  landing on details with the time selected, and the gallery lightbox after a
  real upload from the browser. A prompt 3 test that booked ten hours ahead was
  pinned to tomorrow so it never spills past midnight.
- Screens: `docs/screens/m3/` (home, services, chairs, a profile, gallery,
  visit at 390 and 1280 with sample photos, plus montages).
- Open: Book, Manage and the dashboard keep their prompt 2 and 3 markup until
  milestone 4.

### Milestone 4: Book, Manage, the dashboard and Photos

- Shipped: Book with a StepBar, selectable service rows, chair cards with a
  first-available card, day chips with counts and reasons, times grouped into
  morning, afternoon and evening, the details form with tel and email types, a
  sticky total bar on phones that hides while typing, a Ticket on confirmation
  and fresh times inline with a Toast on a 409. Manage with the same Ticket,
  reschedule reusing the pickers, and cancel as a confirm Sheet. The dashboard
  with a bottom tab bar (Today, Schedule, New, More) and a side nav from 1024px,
  Today as one card per chair with Now, Next and a status switch with Undo, a
  New online bookings chip, the new booking form as a Sheet, block time as a
  Sheet on the schedule, the conflict resolver as a list with chip choices,
  services and staff as lists with edit Sheets, a Photos screen (Hero, Chairs,
  Gallery) with resize to 2000px WebP in the browser, upload progress, required
  alt text, up and down reordering and removal, and a photo picker on each
  staff member. Dark mode follows the system in the admin.
- Tests: e2e for the owner uploading a chair photo through the Photos screen
  with the local driver; the existing booking, admin and site flows pass on the
  restyled screens.
- Screens: `docs/screens/m4/` (book, book with a chair, admin today, schedule,
  photos, services at 390 and 1280, plus montages).
- Open: SEO, icons, the OG image, JSON-LD, the sitemap and Lighthouse are
  milestone 5.
